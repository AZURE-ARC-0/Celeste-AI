# Frequently asked questions
## Why create Celeste?
Honestly I've always been fascinated with computers and more recently Artificial Intelligence and I wanted to challenge myself.
I see Celeste as a good challenge that brings joy to lots of users she comes across so I want to see how far I can take it!

## Current Computer Specs:
* (1x) RTX 3090 ASUS STRIX
* Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10700k CPU

## What coding language is Celeste programmed in?
Python

## Open source code?
No, Celeste is intended to stay private.

## What languages does Celeste speak?
* English

I wish to expand this list further in the future if possible.

## Are you collecting data?
* I do not currently nor intend to collect data beyond what is neccessary for my function, it is trashed once it is not needed anymore, except on the rare occasion for moderation.

## Celeste seems to be able to call back on previous topics! SO YOU ARE COLLECTING DATA?!
* No, Celeste only caches the previous 20 messages back (10 messages for the user, and 10 for her).
* Conversation is reset after 30 seconds, OR when her conversational buffer max is hit, she will remove the oldest.
