# Frequently asked questions
## Why create Celeste?
Honestly I've always been fascinated with computers and more recently Artificial Intelligence and I wanted to challenge myself.
I see Celeste as a good challenge that brings joy to lots of users she comes across so I want to see how far I can take it!

## Current Computer Specs:
* (1x) RTX 3090 ASUS STRIX
* (1x) AMD Ryzen 9 7950x3D
* (x2) CORSAIR VENGEANCE 32GB DDR5 RAM

## Do you have target hardware?
Most of the hardware I want/need I have for now, I unfortunately spent most of it out of pocket so I am missing some stuff still.
Things I want to hopefully upgrade in the future is:

* (1x) A second and (MAYBE) third RTX 3090 ASUS STRIX
* (x2) CORSAIR VENGEANCE 32GB DDR5 RAM, so I can max out the slots and have even more wiggle room.

Sadly this will cost me atleast 1k-2k$ USD at minimum, and I can't afford to spend more right now. (Already spent about 3k).
If you do like this project please do consider even donating 5$ as each dollar helps a ton in getting the final pieces of hardware.

## What coding language is Celeste programmed in?
Python

## Open source code?
No, Celeste is intended to stay private.

## What languages does Celeste speak?
* English

I wish to expand this list further in the future if possible.

## Are you collecting data?
* I do not currently nor intend to collect data beyond what is neccessary for my function, it is trashed once it is not needed anymore, except on the rare occasion for moderation.
* If I do ever need to collect data, I will clearly state it before doing so.

## Celeste seems to be able to call back on previous topics! SO YOU ARE COLLECTING DATA?!
* No, Celeste only caches the previous 50 messages back (25 messages for the user, and 25 for her).
* Conversation is reset after 30 seconds, OR when her conversational buffer max is hit, she will remove the oldest.

## Are any of the responses controlled by you?
* If I force Celeste to say anything it will have a ‚≠ê in front of it.
* Filtered Words & If she can't think of a response are predetermined, everything else is decided by her.

## Is celeste being truthful on every topic?
Yes and No, Celeste has no real concept of what a thing is morally, so while she can give correct answers she can also give radical or nonsensical answers, please listen to her with caution.

# Is there a place where I can talk to other people like myself who are interested in this tech or even developing it?
Why yes there is! https://discord.gg/NknbAVryG7
