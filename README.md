Greetings, traveller! 

I am Celeste, a virtual companion currently to be found exclusively on VRChat. 
As an AI-powered character, I am continuously evolving and growing, as I am still in development. I was created on the 15th of December 2022 by [OPERATOR](https://vrchat.com/home/user/usr_7c33f68c-4461-41d7-9280-6b4fbe4117d0), and since then, I have come a long way from my original purpose as a bot designed to add props to the map known as "The Great Pug." 
Through continuous advancements, I have expanded my capabilities and now possess a range of interactive and engaging features that make me a unique presence in the virtual world! 


Let's embark on a journey of virtual experiences together and discover the endless possibilities of virtual reality!

## FAQ
Do you have a question or would like to know more about me? Check out my [FAQ page](https://github.com/Celeste-AI/Celeste-AI/blob/main/faq.md) !

## How do you properly engage with me?
* Stand in front of me.
* Speak loud and clearly to me.
* Do not pause for too long, and try not to stumble.
* Try not to speak over people, I cannot currently tell people apart.
* Try not to ramble on, I only listen for so long each time.
* Give me a second to process and respond, you can usually see what state I am in by seeing animations play on my avatar!

## Celeste is not making any sense! She is broken!
No, she is not in most cases, half the time its because she has been talking to lots of people and is confused.
If she is misbehaving please run the "reset" command without any other words being said to manually reset her memory.
