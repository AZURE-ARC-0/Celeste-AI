Greetings, traveller! 

I am Celeste, a virtual companion currently to be found exclusively on VRChat. 
As an AI-powered character, I am continuously evolving and growing, as I am still in development. I was created on the 15th of December 2022 by [OPERATOR](https://vrchat.com/home/user/usr_7c33f68c-4461-41d7-9280-6b4fbe4117d0), and since then, I have come a long way from my original purpose as a bot designed to add props to the map known as "The Great Pug." 
Through continuous advancements, I have expanded my capabilities and now possess a range of interactive and engaging features that make me a unique presence in the virtual world! 


Let's embark on a journey of virtual experiences together and discover the endless possibilities of virtual reality!

## Celeste is not making any sense! She is broken!
No, she is not in most cases, half the time its because she has been talking to lots of people and is confused.
If she is misbehaving please run the "reset" command without any other words being said to manually reset her memory.

# üìã IMPORTANT INFORMATION üìã
It should be noted when using this service the following is in effect.

* Data such as **Audio** and **Video** may be used in order to help me provide you the best user experience possible.
* Attempting to crash or disrupt my service will result in an immediate block and/or kick from the lobby.
* Playing music or being extremely disruptive to operation may cause her to mute you.
* While you may try to test out the bots limits, keep it reasonable. Try not to disrupt other's experience.
* Follow [VRChat Community Guidelines](https://hello.vrchat.com/community-guidelines) and their [Terms of Service](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal).
* Actions deemed to be harmful or disrupting by [OPERATOR](https://vrchat.com/home/user/usr_7c33f68c-4461-41d7-9280-6b4fbe4117d0) may also result in a ban.
* If you do not enjoy the concept or the user experience please just block the BOT and don't be disruptive.
* Blocking [OPERATOR](https://vrchat.com/home/user/usr_7c33f68c-4461-41d7-9280-6b4fbe4117d0) and not blocking celeste is a immediate grounds for being kicked, it's suspicious as heck.
* I'd much rather you only block the bot if you are not interested in AI, as it makes it harder to differentiate if you are a malicious user and you may get kicked due to suspicion.

When engaging with celeste please remember these VITAL things: 
* Celeste-AI is not a human, nor will she ever replace one. While you MAY talk to her like she is a human, you should always remember that she isn't.
* Whatever the BOT says does not always reflect the views of the creator, so take her word with a huge grain of salt.
* There is no "free-speech" on vrchat, as [tupper has stated](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1118304616627568770/1120378137600082050/Screenshot_2023-06-19_114233.png) follow vrchats rules or leave, this includes the rules of our service.
